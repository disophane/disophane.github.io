    <h1><strong>About this site::YES THIS PAGE HAS A BUG AND I WILL FIX IT SOON</strong></h1>

    <div class="text1">
        <p>I started making this in November 2023 because I wanted to learn about <Strong><i>Web Development</i></Strong> so I can freelance but recenetly 
        I got accepted into college so I moved to Male' City in order to persue my education in Information Technology. I will also be employed soon so 
    I will have less time to actually go on about learning about <Strong><i>Web Development</i></Strong> so it's just sort of a free time thing now.<br>
I will still be working on improving this site but it's going to be really slow as I won't have much free time. It might take weeks for a single commit to be pushed on this website's Github respository.</p>
